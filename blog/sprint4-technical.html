      Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you Got blocked on a simple problem, and when you solved a problem elegantly.

During this sprint, we had to solve a problem call Super-FizzBuzz. In this problem we had two parts to solve. The first part we had to write a function that took a number value (x), or multiple number values (x, y), and returned a string ('Fizz', 'Buzz', or 'FizzBuzz') in its place if the value met certain conditions (whether x or y, were divisible by; three, five, or both, each with a remainder of zero), otherwise it returned the same number value. This part of the challenge was simple. I worte out pseudocode to plan what my function was going to do, I wrote out my first attempt at the solution to get the numbers to pass each condition test using an if else statement to seperate the conditions. I got the first two conditions to pass but I got mildly stuck trying to apply the last condition to the numbers. For about half an hour, I thought the code I wrote for that condition, was somehow incorrect. I tried changing the code and it kept returning the same error. I was a bit frustrated and realised I was at an impass, so I took a break. I made a new cup of coffee, ate some food and sat down for 10 minutes to reset. After, I came back to the problem and decided to rubber ducky with my cat. Through this I realised that it was failing the tests because of the placement in the function it had (being the last condition in the if ... else statement before returning the same number back), so it was returning the incorrect string values as the numbers were passing the earlier conditions before getting to the statement with multiple conditions to meet. I then moved the statement with multiple conditions to meet, to the first position in the if else statement. This passed all tests for this part and I felt a feeling of acomlishment. 

The second part was far more challenging. I had to figure out how to apply the same conditions to an array and return the new array. I started by trying to write an almost identical function that would apply the same method to the second function, and splice the string values back into the arrays and return that array. I managed to get the first condition to pass with this method then got stuck for an hour thrying to get the second condition to pass. At this point I decided I needed a new method so I took another break, came back, read the instructions in the handbook and realised that I could apply the FizzBuzz function to the Super-FizzBuzz arrays. I also checked the foundations chat for any advice concerning this and I found a thread discussing methods they used. Using this I had started by re-writing the pseudocode to reflect the new method I was going to take to solve the problem. Recycling the fizzbuzz function into the super-fizzbuzz function allowed me to write a more concise, cleaner piece of code.

Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:

Pseudocode
Using pseudocode helps me to plan how my piece of code will be written, and what function each line will have. It will be very useful and continued use will build up my confidence with this process.
Trying something
Trying something is a hit or miss option that I can try in the early stages of problem solving if the solution isn't immediately obvious or I don't understand the problem. If it is right, I can then figure out how/why I was unsure/wrong. If it is wrong, I can either try something else, or move onto the next problem solving method. I find using this can be helpful when it produces the right solution.
Rubber ducky method
I use this quite often when I'm stuck. It helps me identify when I'm stuck in a way of thinking and/or if a particular part of an idea is wrong. It allows me to check if the knowledge I was using to form the idea was foundationally correct.
Reading error messages
Reading error messages helps me identify what is wrong with my code, and where the error has occured. It points me in the right direction to go about fixing what is wrong. I feel i use this technique often when writing code.
Console.logging
Console.logging helps me check what the output of my code will be and tells me if there are errors in my code. Im not terribly fluent with using this method. But with practice...
Googling
Googling has helped me with many sorts of problems I've had throughout my life. I feel very confident using the absolute encycolpaedia of human history to find the answers to my problems, or to shed light on information that will lead me on the way to do so.
Asking your peers for help
Although I am a little hesitant to do so, I feel comfortable to ask for help from other students. If they understand something I don't, why shouldn't I ask them for their understanding?
Asking coaches for help
Same as above.
Improving your process with reflection
I often reflect on my undertakings. Reflecting helps me to identify what processes worked well for me and what didn't. It can give me something to learn from to then take and use on new problems of a similar nature.
