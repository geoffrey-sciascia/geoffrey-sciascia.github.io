    <h2>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>I would liken HTML and CSS to phtosynthetic Coralites and Zooxanthillae respectively. Coral build their own structures and house the Zooxanthillae in their flesh which surround the structure. And in turn, the Zooxanthillae provide the coral with nutrients, and colour the coral. Neither can survive without the other, and if there is something wrong with either, both animals die. Basically the Zooxanthillae provide content to the Coral, and the Coral provides structure for the Zooxanthillae.</p>
    <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h2>
    <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>
    <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>
