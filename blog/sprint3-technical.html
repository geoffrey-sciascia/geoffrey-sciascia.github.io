    <h2>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>I would liken HTML and CSS to phtosynthetic Coralites and Zooxanthillae respectively. Coral build their own structures and house the Zooxanthillae in their flesh which surround the structure. And in turn, the Zooxanthillae provide the coral with nutrients, and colour the coral. Neither can survive without the other, and if there is something wrong with either, both animals die. Basically the Zooxanthillae provide content to the Coral, and the Coral provides structure for the Zooxanthillae.</p>
    <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h2>
        <p>Control flow in JavaScript refers to how the computer reads and executes code. Conventionally, it is read the same way a book is read, from left to right and top to bottom, however if there are statements such as loops, conditionals, or function, the computer will read the code the dircetion given. Think of the elements for the code as the method in a recipe. You must follow all steps starting from one and implement them in order to get to the desired outcome. If you do something different from the method, the outcome will be different also.</p>
        <p>Loops repeat a given function, 'x' amount of times. You can look at loops by imaginging in your recipe, you have an instruction asking you to complete a process an amount of times before moving onto the next step.</p>
    <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>
      <p>The DOM (or document object model) is a way of looking at an HTML document in a way that shows each element represented as nodes and objects, and how they are related to each other. This is shaped like a tree. You interect with the DOM using JavaScript code to do things such as manipulate, create, and delete elements.</p>
    <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
        <p>To access data from an array, you need to write out the name of the array followed by a [number] inside of square brackets. The number represents which element you are trying to access from the array. To access the first element of an array you use zero. An example array, cats, has the elements, winston, john,and sally. To access the first element of this array, you would write cats[0] and this would return winston.</p>
        <p>To access data from an object, you need to write out the name of the object, followed by a period ('.'), then the name of the property (or key) you are accessing. This would return the property value. An example object, cat, has the property and its value, name and winston respectively. To access the property value of this object, you would write cat.name and this would return winston.</p>
    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>
      <p>A JavaScript function is code that resembles a set of instructions that perform tasks or calculate values. It should take custom inputs (parameters) and give an output (return a value). There should be an obvious relationship between the input and output. It starts with the word 'function', continues after a space with the name of the function, a parameter/list of parameters inside of brackets and separated by commas, and then inside of curly brackets, your JavaScript statements that define the function. It is handy to use as the same function can be recycled again and again for different uses.</p>
