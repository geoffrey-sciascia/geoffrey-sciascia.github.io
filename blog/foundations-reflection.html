        <h2>
            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have learnt that I already had most of the tools behind the core learnings, I just needed to piece them together and put names to them. It reinforced the ideas and values I held myself to, and allowed me to see my strengths and use them. I've learnt it's okay to be confident in some piece of knowledge and not in some other piece of knowledge, so long as you have the humility to help without judgement or are brave enough to ask for help.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?
        </h2>
        <p>
            These come in when dealing with other people, so fairly often. You have to know how to navigate hard conversations and understand how the things we say and do can affect other people.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
            How much of it I already put into practice, and how much of it I was taught as a child.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I found it all fairly easy. My biggest challenge was lettign down my walls to the other students when I needed help. I have been able to do so and have formed a few new friendships with my fellow students.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        </h2>
        <p>
            As has been said to us, one of the main goals you guys have in teaching us is at the end, we have all the skills to land a job in tech. You guys have gone out to the industry to find out what they need in their employees and you guys are teaching it.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Not at all. It has organised my pre existing skills and strengthened my less practiced soft skills. I'm glad to have had this as part of the curriculum as it has also furthered my self learning from therapy.
