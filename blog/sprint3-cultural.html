        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence (EQ)?</h2>
        <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions, 
            not just in yourself, but also in others. It is closely tied to empathy. </p>
        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>IQ is used to indentify an individuals who are 'gifted' learners, or 
            inversely, those who require specialised assistance with learning. EQ is 
            used to identify leadership qualities in individuals. EQ looks at; <ul class="ilu"><li>
            How an individual identifies, evaluates, controls and expresses emotions.</li> <li>In their own 
            emotions; how they perceive, and assess the emotions they are feeling.</li> <li>Others' emotions; how they get others to use emotions to 
            facilitate thinking and understand the emotional meanings.</li></ul> IQ looks at;
            <ul class="ilu"><li>The ability to learn, understand and apply information to skills,</li> <li>Logical 
            reasoning,</li> <li>Word comprehension and math skills,</li> <li>Abstract and spatial thinking,</li> 
            <li>And filtering out irrelevant information.</li></ul> These aspects of intelligence need to work together. 
            Emotional intelligence is an enabler for the development of a higher IQ.</p>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is key to having a successful relationship with 
            yourself and others. A high EQ helps you to build relationships, reduce 
            team stress, defuse conflict and improve job satisfaction. Ultimately, a 
            high EQ means having the potential to increase team productivity and staff 
            retention. Thatâ€™s why when it comes to recruiting management roles, employers 
            look to hire and promote candidates with a high EQ rather than IQ. Numerous 
            studies have linked emotional intelligence to critical life success factors, 
            such as better effectiveness, relationships, wellbeing and quality of life.</p>
