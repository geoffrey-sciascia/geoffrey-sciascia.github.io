    <p>This page is where I explain a little about myself in regards to my identity, values, and strengths</p>
    <h2>Core Values:</h2>
    <p>Empathy/compassion; Working for McDonalds, I met and trained a lot of young people, some of which didn't have great lives outside of work. With those people I always made sure they knew I was available to come to and have a chat about their lives/themselves. During these chats I would listen to their problems, concerns, and paths taken to get to where they ended up. From this information I would formulate advice for them to practice, or actions they could take to improve their situations. My last role in the organisation was as the people and performance manager for my store, so I had to be approachable and come with a wealth of not just McDonalds knowledge, but also 'human skills' and the ability to adapt them to fit other people and for them to be able to implement them.</p>
    <p>Advocation; In my last relationship, My ex had a lot of employment troubles, and seemed to be jumping from job to job fairly quickly. I took it upon myself to become not just a support person, but representation for them at disciplinary meetings. Using my wealth of people practice and employment law knowledge from my time at McDonalds, I was able to out logic 3 of their previous employers in a row into paying out a termination fee, admit they treated my ex unfairly, and admit they hadn't followed proper people practices or employment law. From there they looked at their internal HR systems and improved them.</p>
    <p>Creativity; I have always been rather creative from my formative years to now. I love all forms of art and enjoy learning new mediums/methods. 3d sculpture being my favourite. The last project I had that involved 3d sculpture was when I had my mixed reef tanks. 3D sculpture comes in as aquascaping. It involved constant changeups as coral grew and warfare initiated between non-compatible genotyoes of coral. I had to balance aesthetics with function to maintain a great look, and happy/safe coral. I also use creativity when making shift/department decisions at work. I like to gain perspective from others (crew to restaurant manager) on matters of importance and apply them to my own to create a collaborative idea to push to the restaurant manager and general manager/ops consultant. That way a balanced idea is proposed instead of one fully formed from my own perspective and opinions.</p>
    
    <br>My upbringing influenced my compassionate side and nurtured my creative side for the most part. Growing up, my mother had much praise for the compassionate side of me, and because of that, it became a core value for me throughout my life. Both parents nurtured my creative side from performing to visual arts. I gained advocation as a core value as an adult through work and a previous relationship.</p>

    <h2>Strengths:</h2>
    <p>Knowledge bank; I tend to pick up information really easily and commit that knowledge to memory. It has helped me with working with McDonalds as there is a lot of procedure and policy to remember and inform/teach to others. It will help me with my learning journey with Dev Academy for the same reasons. This could become a learning obsticle if I pick up a bad habit or use an incorrect process. It would be tricky to backtrack and overwrite the information.</p>
    <p>Collaborate with others; I compare my knowledge/perspective with those of other people. This helps me to present a balanced idea, not formed solely from my own opinions and perception, to my superiors. It will help me in my learning journey as it is encouraged by Dev Academy to all students to compare ideas, and help others where you can with their journeys. This could be a learning obsticle for me if I am given incorrect advice for a problem.</p>
    <p>Dilligence; When I undertake a task, I like to fully immerse myself in said task. I can ignore all external stimuli and focus solely on what is in front of me until I am satisfied with the completion of the task. It will help me with my learning journey as I am particularly interested by all the course material I have encountered so far, and expect it to stay that way, and this will ensure my continued current efforts. I believe this could become a learning obsticle if I get stuck and cant figure out the problem on my own.</p>
    <h2>limitations:</h2>
    <p>Perfectionistic; I strive to be as close to perfect in everything I do as possible. This can work to my detriment if I am working on something that im not getting quite right, and I can then easily fall down the rabbit hole of spending endless amounts of time trying to remedy/complete the task/process.</p>
    <p>Reluctance to open up; I am getting better at this, mostly with the help of therapy. But I still can identify this trait in myself. I tend to ask for help as a last resort and would like to get into the habit of asking before I get too far down the rabbit hole.</p>
    <p>Fierce independance; This in most cases would be considered a strength, but here, it could be perceived as a limitation. Collaboration is encouraged, but like above I tend to ask for help too late.</p>
    
    <br>Working for a hospitality business as a department manager, I realised how driven the business was to deliver on productivity. To get the most out of your staff, the shift manager needs to work with their area managers/runners to create a highly productive environment. I've had a few shifts where one of my area managers has ignored my suggestion/direction. Yes, it was frustrating, but I kept my cool and just ran with it because giving calls, and not receiving any back, was just frustrating me further so I let them make their job harder than it had to be. The next day I called for a meeting with the restaurant manager, and the are manager. At the meeting we discussed our motives and how we can avoid a situation like that in the future. Unfortunately my strategy of backing off and addressing the issue the next day, wasn't very affective for the shift, but it was positive in the long run because the staff memeber and I had a better working relationship from then on. Looking back I could have swapped the area manager out to a crew station and swapped another manager into that position and still call for the chat the next day.</p>
