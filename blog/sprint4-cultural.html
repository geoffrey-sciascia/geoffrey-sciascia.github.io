        <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>

        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
        Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to modify, change, and adapt its' own structure and function throughout life and in response to experience. Studies have shown that when people understand the principles of neuroplasticity, they perform better when learning a new task and executing it. This is because when you are aware of your own neuroplasticity, your learning capacity isn't bound to the idea that we are all born with limited intelligence, but rather, through persistence and repetition, your brain can learn any piece of knowledge or task.
        
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit
        The principles I will engage the most with to enhance my own learning are 'Use it and improve it', 'Repetition matters', and 'Salience matters'. I know that my learning style is kinetic, meaning in order for me to commit a piece of knowledge to memeory, I need to learn, perform, and repeat the use of the piece of knowledge a few times. This covers the first two principles. What makes it easier for me to commit the piece of knowledge to memeory, is how relevant it is to my future. When I know the knowledge will be cruital to my future, I am driven to master it. That covers the last.
        
        What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
        Playing video games, learning a new language, making some music, travelling, exercising, and making art are all ways to increase neuroplasticity. Each of these help in their own ways.
        Video games: -motor coordination
                     -visual recognition and spatial navigation
                     -memory and reaction time
                     -reasoning, decision making, and problem-solving skills
                     -resilience
                     -cooperation and team participation
        Languages: -language
                   -attention
                   -memory
                   -emotions
                   -motor skills
                   -stronger problem-solving and creative thinking skills
                   -improved vocabulary
                   -greater reading comprehension
                   -increased ability to multitask
        Music: -mood
               -ability to learn and remember new information
               -concentration and focus
               -better audio and visual perception
               -greater focus and attention
               -better memory
               -better motor coordination
        Travel: -enhance cognitive flexibility
                -inspire you
                -enhance creativity
        Exercise: -improve fine motor skills
                  -improve brain connectivity
        Art: -create new pathways and strengthen existing connections in your brain

        Research Growth Mindset
        
        Discuss what it is and why it is relevant
        Having a 'Growth Mindset' is the act of taking on challenges (easy or difficult), and learning from the outcome of the experience to improve the result next time. Growth mindset is relevent to Neuroplasticity because it drives the foundation priciples involved with neuroplasticity by understanding that; when you take the time and effort, you can learn, do, and accomplish anything you set your mind to.
        
        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
        Not at all. Growing up, my parents were strong advocates of the philosophy that 'You can do anything you put your mind to'. As a result I feel I have always incorporated this philosophy into all spaces of my life. I can't remember a time where I have thought, 'this is too hard', only, 'how will I do better next time?'.
        
        How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
        I already have a type of proto-growth mindset. Now that I have the full description, I can merge it into my current philosophy as stated above and form a complete 'Growth Mindset'.

        Blend with your learning plan and strategies
        
        Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.
        There aren't many changes to how I will be learning, but the most significant one is, 'Use it and improve it'. This will differ from my usual study pattern as I would normally take days off, usually in the weekend, from study to reset the 'knowledge absorbing' part fo my brain. With my current learning plan I have set aside half an hour every day, including in the weekend, to practice coding on my own blog website. This will help the repetition side of the neuroplasticity going on in my brain regerding coding, but not overload my 'days off'. The main benefit I see from this is that I will become more comfortable writing code and become fluent faster. I am motivated to do continue this behavior as it directly impacts my future as a web developer positively.
