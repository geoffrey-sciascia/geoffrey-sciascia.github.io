        <p>My long term goal, say 5 years from now, I hope to be a qualified cloud engineer. To get there I have chosen to start with web development. Web development will give me a firm base knowledge for coding and allow me to move onto other fields in the IT industry, like software development and cloud development, with ease.</p>

        <p>Skills I hope to build through the EDA curriculum in regards to ‘human skills’ are centred around self-record keeping, timing, and get back into a more structured form of self-organisation. </p>
        <p>To aid the record keeping I will keep a daily diary through my learning journey to help myself reflect daily on my progress and identify possible learning and progress barriers.</p>
        <p>To help keep time, I will use the Toggle timer as instructed by EDA. This will help me keep on task and identify if I am spending the right amount of time for me on a task. I will use the time box suggestions and compare them to my actual times spent on each task. With this information I can adjust the suggested time to form my own time box.</p>
        <p>Before I attended therapy, I was rather highly strung and as a result, was extremely organised. Therapy helped break down some negative traits in me, but it also got me to not take myself as seriously as I used to. The result from this was that I had a much more casual approach to organisation than what I used to. I am re-training myself to get back into my old organisational habits while keeping a casual attitude toward my own self.</p>

        <p>I will use my strengths to mitigate my limitations. This will help me manage my workload as through the first core challenge, I feel identified these traits well and have a good understanding of how they affect my productivity. I will have to flex my ‘Collaborate with others’ and ‘Diligence’ muscles a bit more to encourage myself to reach out to others in the course, including the other students and facilitators.</p>

        <p>As part of core1, I listed these. They are as follows;</p>
        <p>Strengths:</p>
            <ul class="ilu">
                <li><p>Knowledge bank; I tend to pick up information really easily and commit that knowledge to memory. It has helped me with working with McDonalds as there is a lot of procedure and policy to remember and inform/teach to others. It will help me with my learning journey with Dev Academy for the same reasons. This could become a learning obstacle if I pick up a bad habit or use an incorrect process. It would be tricky to backtrack and overwrite the information.</p></li>
                <li><p>Collaborate with others; I compare my knowledge/perspective with those of other people. This helps me to present a balanced idea, not formed solely from my own opinions and perception, to my superiors. It will help me in my learning journey as it is encouraged by Dev Academy to all students to compare ideas, and help others where you can with their journeys. This could be a learning obstacle for me if I am given incorrect advice for a problem.</p></li>
                <li><p>Diligence; When I undertake a task, I like to fully immerse myself in said task. I can ignore all external stimuli and focus solely on what is in front of me until I am satisfied with the completion of the task. It will help me with my learning journey as I am particularly interested by all the course material I have encountered so far, and expect it to stay that way, and this will ensure my continued current efforts. I believe this could become a learning obstacle if I get stuck and cant figure out the problem on my own.</p></li>
            </ul>
        <p>Limitations:</p>
            <ul class="ilu">
                <li><p>Perfectionistic; I strive to be as close to perfect in everything I do as possible. This can work to my detriment if I am working on something that I’m not getting quite right, and I can then easily fall down the rabbit hole of spending endless amounts of time trying to remedy/complete the task/process.</p></li>
                <li><p>Reluctance to open up; I am getting better at this, mostly with the help of therapy. But I still can identify this trait in myself. I tend to ask for help as a last resort and would like to get into the habit of asking before I get too far down the rabbit hole.</p></li>
                <li><p>Fierce independence; This in most cases would be considered a strength, but here, it could be perceived as a limitation. Collaboration is encouraged, but like above I tend to ask for help too late.</p></li>
            </ul>
        <p>I need to make sure that when I get stuck, I am reaching out to ask for help. Before I do this I will make sure to spend a small amount of time debugging my problem myself and then researching possible solutions through google. For this process I will set myself a time limit of 30 minutes. If I feel close, I will push through for another 10 minutes before throwing in the towel and asking for help in the foundations chat. If this doesn’t yield results in another 15 minutes, I will bring my problem to my course facilitator, Naomi.</p>

        <p>From the facilitation team at Dev Academy, I expect them to create an open learning space for the students to collaborate freely within, and for them to do their jobs as described in their job description. As this is a flipped learning situation, I understand that the facilitators are not directly my teachers, and don’t expect them to be on call to help every student with every problem as soon as they arise. However, I do expect them to acknowledge when a problem is brought to them, and endeavour to help guide us with said problems where they can.</p>

        <p>The only block-out time I have during the week is my work on Sundays. I have planned to continue working throughout my learning journey. On this day I will also be spending time working on the code for my blog for at least 2-4 hours depending on what time my shift is rostered. If it’s an early shift, I will do my coding in the afternoon for 4 hours, and if it’s a later start, I will spend 2 hours coding in the morning before work.</p>
